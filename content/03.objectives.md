## Objectives

In this study, we aim to answer questions regarding the integration of biological data from PanglaoDB in Wikidata, analysing items such as cell types, genes and tissues. Some of the questions we gathered so far are:

* How many cell types in PanglaoDB are also present in Wikidata? How many of those items are exact matches?

* Of those that are exact matches, how many statements do they have associated? Are these items well annotated?

* How does the coverage of biological items differ within Wikidata? Are the items for tissues and genes better annotated? How so?
    * Do items with alternative identifiers, such as genes, have their alternative identifiers indexed within Wikidata?

In the end, we'll have gathered and analysed enough data to formulate a report on the integration of this knowledge.
